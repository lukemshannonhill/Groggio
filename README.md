Hi there!

And welcome to... Groggio!

Groggio is a fun exploration of the Pygame library, and owes its existence to the wonderful Youtube channel KidsCanCode.

I created Groggio both because I'm interested in exploring the mechanics of creating a game with Python and because I wanted a game playground I fully understood in which to deploy a few machine learning agents. This second part is under development--please stay tuned and check back for more!

Below is a link to the playlist I used to create Groggio--check 'em out!

My implementation differs slightly from the reference material linked below. I use slightly different values throughout and use different musical assets.
